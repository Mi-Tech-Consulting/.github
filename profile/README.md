# Develop Guide
Here is the procedure on how to work with the GitHub repo, when you want to start coding:
1. fork the origin repo to your PERSONAL PRIVATE repo
2. working on your new repo, (usually you wanna check out a few feature branches thus to keep the default branch easy to sync and merge from - it is a bit tricky)
3. when your code is ready to merge, pls create a PULL REQUEST from your repo to the origin repo, for 

- branch: use `develop` branch as default
- Pls let us know if you have any questions about this procedure
