## Hi there 👋

# 🌈 Contribution guidelines

Here is the procedure on how to work with the GitHub repo, when you want to start coding:

1. Fork the origin repo to your `PERSONAL PRIVATE repo`
2. Working on your new repo, (usually you wanna check out a few feature branches thus to keep the default branch easy to sync and merge from - it is a bit tricky)
3. When your code is ready to merge, pls create a PULL REQUEST from your repo to the origin repo
4. Before merging, pls make sure you have run the following commands:
   ```shell
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   and then commit the changes to the PR
5. Once the PR is approved, it will be merged to the origin repo
6. Once the PR is merged, you can delete your PR branch

- branch: use `develop` branch as default
- Keep the code clean, style consistent
- Try to use the dependent libraries we provide. If you have special needs, please contact @jhcao23 or @keyskull 
- Always think about code reusability
- Pls let us know if you have any questions about this procedure
